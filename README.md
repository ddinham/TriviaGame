# TriviaGame
This is a great coding project that incorporates Javascript, Jquery and CSS.
It works  by setting a timer and providing the player with a variety of true or false questions that must be answered before the timer finishes.  The player is then provided with the number of answers they got right or wrong.
It is for personal use to practice concepts in coding.  Good game!
